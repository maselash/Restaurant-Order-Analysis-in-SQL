# Restaurant-Order-Analysis-in-SQL
This project focuses on analyzing customer ordering patterns in a restaurant that launched a new menu at the start of last year. Using SQL, I explored how customers responded to the new items, which dishes performed well, and which ones underperformed.

**Objective**

**The analysis aimed to:**

Explore the menu_items table to understand the new menu.

Explore the order_details table to assess customer purchase behavior.

Combine both tables to identify customer preferences and evaluate menu performance.

**Dataset**

menu_items: Details of all items on the new menu.

order_details: Transactional data of customer orders.

**Methodology**

**Data Exploration:**

Queried the menu_items table to review the variety and pricing of menu items.

Analyzed the order_details table to assess order frequency and total spend.

**Data Analysis:**

Performed joins between menu_items and order_details to link purchases with menu items.

Identified top-performing menu items and those that were less popular.

Analyzed top customers and their preferences.

**Insights:**

Uncovered trends in menu item popularity.

Identified customer favorites and spending patterns.

Highlighted underperforming items that may need rebranding, repositioning, or removal.
